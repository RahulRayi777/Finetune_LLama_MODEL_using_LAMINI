## Introduction

LLaMA is a series of foundational language models developed by Meta AI, ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. Lamini is an AI framework designed to simplify the process of fine-tuning large language models, making it accessible and efficient.

## Features

- **Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Utilize Lamini's tools to fine-tune LLaMA models with reduced computational resources.
- **Custom Task Adaptation**: Tailor the LLaMA model to specific tasks such as text classification, summarization, or translation.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate fine-tuned models into applications using Lamini's deployment tools.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Finetune_LLama_MODEL_using_LAMINI.git
