## Introduction

LLaMA is a series of foundational language models developed by Meta AI, ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. Lamini is an AI framework designed to simplify the process of fine-tuning large language models, making it accessible and efficient.

## Features

- **Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Utilize Lamini's tools to fine-tune LLaMA models with reduced computational resources.
- **Custom Task Adaptation**: Tailor the LLaMA model to specific tasks such as text classification, summarization, or translation.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate fine-tuned models into applications using Lamini's deployment tools.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Finetune_LLama_MODEL_using_LAMINI.git
   cd Finetune_LLama_MODEL_using_LAMINI

Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure that requirements.txt includes all necessary packages such as torch, transformers, lamini, etc.

Usage
Data Preparation
Collect and Preprocess Data: Gather the dataset relevant to your task and preprocess it into a format suitable for training (e.g., JSON, CSV).

Tokenization: Use the appropriate tokenizer to convert text data into tokens compatible with the LLaMA model.

Fine-Tuning
Configure Training Parameters: Set parameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc., in the configuration file or script.

Run Fine-Tuning Script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python finetune.py --config configs/finetune_config.json
Ensure that finetune.py contains the necessary code to load the dataset, initialize the model, and perform fine-tuning using Lamini.

Evaluation
Evaluate Model Performance: After fine-tuning, assess the model's performance on a validation or test set to ensure it meets the desired criteria.

Deploy the Model: Use Lamini's deployment tools to integrate the fine-tuned model into your application.
